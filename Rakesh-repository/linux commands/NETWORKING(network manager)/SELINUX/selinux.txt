==additional layer of system security. May a web server access files in users' home directories
=as restricting specific applications to only viewing log files, while allowing other applications to append new data to the log files
4t also removes any ambiguity that can be found in other identification methods; for example, a file can have multiple valid path names on a system that makes use of bind mounts.
5 there is a policy rule that permits Apache (the web server process running as httpd_t) to access files and directories with a context normally found in /var/www/html/ and other web server directories (httpd_sys_content_t)

7SELinux can be used to enforce data confidentiality and integrity, as well as protecting processes from untrusted inputs.
8t is important to continue to follow good security practices, such as keeping software up-to-date, using hard-to-guess passwords, or firewalls

Permissive mode, in which permission denials are logged but not enforced(but can access and cannot edit access and custom log).
Enforcing mode, in which permissions denials are both logged and enforced.

An SELinux-hardened system will run with SELinux in enforcing mode, meaning that the SELinux policy is in effect and the policies will be followed according to it very strictly.

Permissive mode comes handy when trying to debug or allow some features to run on some instances which are not allowed in enforcing mode.This allows us to have a choice on the policies that are enforced.

firewall ==only port level security
selinux-port,file,sevice all 3 level security
